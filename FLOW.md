## 1. Landing Page Flow

2. User taps **Continue** to move through slides.

3. After the last slide, user sees:

---

## 4. Customer Order Flow

### 4.1 Browse & Add to Cart

1. User is on **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`).
2. User taps a category (Food, Grocery, Medicine, etc.) or goes to **Stores**.
3. **Backend:** `GET /stores?category=food|grocery|medicine` returns approved stores filtered by category.
4. User selects a store → **Store Detail** (`/dashboard/stores/[id]`).
5. **Backend:** `GET /stores/:id` returns store + products.
6. User taps **+** to add a product to cart.
7. Cart is stored in Zustand + `localStorage` (persist). No API call until checkout.

### 4.2 Checkout

1. User goes to **Cart** (`/cart`).
2. User taps **Checkout**.
3. **Checkout page** (`/cart/checkout`):
   - **Backend:** `GET /users/me/addresses` loads saved addresses.
   - User selects delivery address (or adds one at `/addresses/new`).
   - User selects payment: Cash on Delivery (COD), Card, or Crypto (Coming Soon).
4. User taps **Place order**.
5. **Backend:** `POST /orders` with:
   - `storeId`, `addressId`, `items: [{ productId, quantity, price }]`, `paymentMethod`
   - Creates order, store earning, order items.
6. Frontend clears cart and redirects to `/order/[id]`.

### 4.3 View Orders

1. **Orders list** (`/orders`):
   - **Backend:** `GET /orders` returns orders for the current customer.
2. User taps an order → **Order detail** (`/order/[id]`).
   - **Backend:** `GET /orders/:id` returns single order with store, address, items, `allowedTransitions`, `statusHistory`.

---

## 4.4 Order State Machine (Strict Status Control)

Order status transitions are **enforced in the backend**. Only valid transitions are allowed per role.

### Status enum
`PENDING` → `STORE_ACCEPTED` | `STORE_REJECTED` | `CANCELLED` → `READY_FOR_PICKUP` → `RIDER_ASSIGNED` → `RIDER_ACCEPTED` → `PICKED_UP` → `DELIVERED` | `CANCELLED`

### Who can change what

| Role | Transition | From → To |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **CUSTOMER** | Cancel | PENDING → CANCELLED |
| **STORE_OWNER** | Accept | PENDING → STORE_ACCEPTED |
| **STORE_OWNER** | Reject | PENDING → STORE_REJECTED |
| **STORE_OWNER** | Mark ready | STORE_ACCEPTED → READY_FOR_PICKUP |
| **ADMIN** | Assign rider | READY_FOR_PICKUP → RIDER_ASSIGNED (requires `riderId`) |
| **ADMIN** | Force cancel | Any (except DELIVERED/CANCELLED) → CANCELLED |
| **RIDER** | Accept | RIDER_ASSIGNED → RIDER_ACCEPTED |
| **RIDER** | Pick up | RIDER_ACCEPTED → PICKED_UP |
| **RIDER** | Deliver | PICKED_UP → DELIVERED |

### API
- **PATCH /orders/:id/status** with `{ status, riderId?, cancellationReason? }`
- Returns 400 if transition is invalid for current status/role
- **OrderStatusHistory** logs every change (`orderId`, `status`, `changedByUserId`, `createdAt`)

### UI
- **Store dashboard** (`/store/dashboard`): Tabs — Orders | Products | Earnings | Settings.
  - **Orders**: New (Accept/Reject), Preparing (Mark Ready), Ready for Pickup, Completed. Auto-refresh 15s.
  - **Products**: Categories CRUD, Products CRUD, stock toggle.
  - **Earnings**: Today summary, delivered orders list.

## 5. Customer Address Flow

**Routes:** `/addresses`, `/addresses/new`

1. User goes to **Delivery Address** (from More or Checkout).
2. **Backend:** `GET /users/me/addresses` returns addresses.

   - User fills Label, Address, City.
   - User taps **Save Address**.
4. **Backend:** `POST /users/me/addresses` with `{ fullAddress, city, latitude, longitude, label, isDefault }`.

## 6. Admin Flow

### 🎯 Admin Dashboard Philosophy

Your admin panel is not for decoration. **It is the brain of Vybe.**

If something breaks in Lahore at 9PM — Admin should see it immediately.

### Admin Dashboard Structure (MVP – Fundraising Ready)

**Main Navigation** (sidebar layout, keep it clean):

- Dashboard
- Orders
- Stores
- Riders
- Partners (Invites)
- Users

---

### 🟢 6.1 Dashboard (Overview Page)

This is what you show investors live.

**Top KPI Cards** (from `GET /admin/metrics`):

**Live Operations Section** (clickable cards):

## 9. Role-Based Route Guards

| Role       | Can Access                         | Cannot Access                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CUSTOMER  | /dashboard, /orders, /cart, /more, etc. | /admin, /rider/*, /store/*                |
| RIDER     | /rider/dashboard                    | /admin, /store/*, customer dashboard      |
| STORE_OWNER | /store/dashboard                 | /admin, /rider/*, customer dashboard     |
| ADMIN     | /admin, all partner routes          | -                                        |

- **Dashboard layout:** Redirects non-CUSTOMER to `/`.
- **Rider layout:** Redirects non-RIDER to `/`, unauthenticated to `/partner-login`.
- **Store layout:** Redirects non-STORE_OWNER to `/`, unauthenticated to `/partner-login`.
- **Admin layout:** Redirects non-ADMIN to `/`, unauthenticated to `/auth/login`.

---

## 10. Auth & Token Flow

1. **Token storage:** JWT stored in `localStorage` (`vybe_token`) and Zustand persist (`vybe_user`).
2. **API requests:** `api` service attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request.
3. **401 response:** API interceptor removes token and dispatches `vybe_unauthorized`.
4. **AuthListener:** Listens for `vybe_unauthorized`, calls `logout()`, redirects to `/auth/login`.

---

## 11. OTP Flow (Customer)


- **Signup:** OTP sent after form submit. Code stored hashed in DB, expires in ~3 minutes.
- **Send:** Via Meta WhatsApp Cloud API (`WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_OTP_TEMPLATE_NAME`); in development only, if unset, OTP is logged to the backend console. Production requires WhatsApp configuration.
- **Verify:** `POST /auth/verify-otp` marks user as verified and returns JWT.

---

## 12. MVP Improvements (Business-Ready)

### Inventory control
- **Product:** `stock` (Decimal), `isOutOfStock` (boolean)
- **Order creation:** Validates stock for each item, reduces atomically in transaction
- **Insufficient stock:** Rejects order with clear message

### Commission logic
- **Platform commission:** 15% of subtotal (per pitch)
- **Store earning:** subtotal − commission
- **Platform earning:** commission (stored in `StoreEarning.commissionAmount`)

### Delivery & fees
- **Delivery fee:** 150 PKR (fixed)
- **Service fee:** Rs 23.49 per order (per pitch)
- **Total:** subtotal + deliveryFee + serviceFee
- **Delivery promise:** 90–120 minutes
- Checkout displays breakdown; payment intent uses full total

### Store open/closed
- **Store:** `openingTime`, `closingTime` (HH:mm)
- **isOpenNow:** Computed from current time vs opening/closing
- **UI:** Banner when closed; "Store closed – orders unavailable" disables ordering
- **Backend:** Rejects order creation when store is closed

### Rate limiting
- **Global:** 100 requests/min per IP (ThrottlerGuard)
- Protects OTP, login, invite validation, order creation

### Admin metrics (`GET /admin/metrics`)
- Total users, total orders, orders today
- Total revenue (platform commission)
- Active riders, active stores

### Cancellation
- **Enum:** CUSTOMER_CANCELLED, STORE_REJECTED, ADMIN_CANCELLED, OUT_OF_STOCK, STORE_CLOSED, OTHER
- **cancelledByRole:** Who cancelled (for analytics)
- Set automatically when status → CANCELLED or STORE_REJECTED

### Order timeline UI
- Order detail shows status history as progress steps (✔ with timestamps)
- Cancelled/rejected shown with ✕
